### **_Description_**

#### Our idea revolves around designing a website specialized in gold that includes gold stores and displays gold prices according to the daily update. Users can register as investors or buyers. The site allows investors to add new stores and manage their products, while buyers can shop by category and add items to their wish list. The site provides a comprehensive and integrated experience for gold lovers.
